        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hello, I&#39;m Bec.  I am a Bachelor of Information Technology student from RMIT, currently in my first year.  I have previously completed the Diploma of Information Technology in 2012 and am excited to be studying again as I am hoping to execute a career change in the coming years.   Currently I have been working in retail for over 15 years holding various positions but am looking forward to working in a field that I believe will be more intellectually stimulating. </p>
        <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
        <p>I am interested in studying IT as it is becoming more and more a part of our lives and in the grand scheme of things I believe it is still in its infancy.  As technology develops further I would like to take part in creating beneficial systems that will change the way things are done, whether it be on a small or large scale.  
            My time spent studying the Diploma of IT was very rewarding and helping to develop applications felt like a natural fit for me with my only regret being that I didn&#39;t start sooner.  Although life has taken me elsewhere for the past few years, I always knew I would return to studying IT again someday and I am fortunate to be in a position that I can do so once again.  
            My experience in IT includes developing a six month long project to build an application used for scheduling in which I was the project manager.  Further to that I can created the occasional website and fixed many PC issues for friends and family over the years.  
            I have chosen to study at RMIT due to their reputation for having an excellent online Bachelor of IT course and I look forward to attending graduation in Melbourne one day.  During my studies with RMIT I hope to refresh and solidify my knowledge of Information Technology and develop and polish new skills.
        </p>
        <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
        <p>Ideally something such as the following would be my ideal career in IT
            https://gyazo.com/15bbac477de122f5fa7a9a317ee191b9
            The appealing thing about a position such as this is that it is all about creating solutions and “making the hard stuff, easy”.   I believe that a position such as this would be both challenging and rewarding as you would be tasked with varying requirements and need good problem solving skills.  Also the culture of the workplace is stated as being relaxed and flexible, which sounds very attractive.  
            The position requires experience with MEAN stack which includes MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS and Node.js (Ibm.com, 2019).  Further to the coding skills the position seeks candidates with problem solving skills, time management skills’ and a willingness to learn.  
            Comparing the job application&#39;s requirements to my own skills, I do not have any experience with the javascript software listed although I do have some javascript experience.  I also am lacking knowledge of the MongoDB, although I have experience with other database languages such as MySQL.  On the soft skills front however I believe I do have excellent time management and problem solving skills.  
            In order to gain the experience and necessary skills for a position such as the one listed above I would need to learn more about the MEAN stack and the best way to do that would be to develop some websites using it.  Ideally each website I was to develop would utilise each part of the MEAN stack, the Express.js web application server framework (Expressjs.com, 2017), the frontend Angular.js framework (Medium, 2017), the Node.js server runtime environment (Node.js, 2020) and the MongoDB database (MongoDB, 2020).  I believe that all of the resources I would need to learn and implement each framework would be easily found online, furthermore I feel that I may get the opportunity to explore some of the required skills as part of my studies and course work.  
        </p>
        <h1>Personality Profile</h1>
        <p>According to the Myers-Briggs personality test I have a INTJ – Introverted, Intuitive Thinking Judging personality which is described as being self confident, perfectionistic and imaginative.  (Butt, 1998) http://www.humanmetrics.com/personality/intj
            My learning style, according to Education Planner.org&#39;s learning style test is a Visual/Tactile learner.  Visual learners learn by picturing what they are learning in their head or by viewing pictures.  Tactile learners learn by touching things and attempting tasks. (Educationplanner.org, 2019) http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=6&V=7&T=7
            Finally, my results of a DISC test (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Conscientiousness) lists me as an Analyst type. https://gyazo.com/1738bc8105776e2010e343ccc9b281bb.  This lists persons with this type of profile to be analytical, preferring facts and data over opinions and ideas.  
            https://www.crystalknows.com/
            The results of these personality tests do feel like an accurate reflection on who I am as a person as I do tend to be analytical and can find myself focusing on details and knowing the facts before forming my opinions.  I also feel as though I can focus too hard on what I believe to be potential solutions, dismissing ideas that I find inadequate too quickly after briefly analysing them.  
            I feel these results could influence my behaviour in a team by making me more aware of what impacts my behaviours may have on others within groups, being matter-of-fact when approaching situations and not being as open to trying things that I believe may not work.  When disagree with other&#39;s ideas I need to ensure I am giving my reasons why and not dismissing them too quickly.
            When forming a team I would try to find members with similar values however I feel I could benefit from working with many other types of personality profiles who would bring diversity in the way they approach tasks.  Working with other personality types would broaden our teams approach as I may find myself dismissing ideas too quickly if I don’t believe they would be suitable.  
        </p>
        <h1>My Project Idea</h1>
        <p>An idea for a project that I would like to develop is for establishing a mentoring community that would span across multiple industries.  Already many industries have excellent support systems in place online, for example developers regularly help each other on platforms such as Stack Overflow and GitHub but I would like to develop a centralised platform where anyone who needs support in their profession can find it.   Ideally the platform will reward those that use it and offer more personalised support than what one would receive anonymously on the internet.  Users would be able to leave feedback and reviews and develop reputations based on their efforts.  
            The motivation for this project is the fear of the unknown after we graduate, as much as we prepare ourselves for our transition into our profession career once we leave study we lose the support network of our teachers & fellow students.  We can continue to find support in online communities or if we are lucky we may find mentors when we enter the workforce but for many the help that they receive is impersonal and there is no investment in helping you to develop your skills further.  
            A platform designed to be beneficial to both its users seeking help and to those that are providing it would help encourage the inexperienced to build confidence and solidify their skills.
        </p>
        <h2>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h2>
        <p>This mentoring platform is designed to connect junior professionals, students, or anyone who is seeking guidance with experts that can provide it, utilising chat and collaboration features.  
            The benefits of mentoring are well established, providing support during the early stages of career development, diversifying perspectives and identifying skill shortfalls.   There are also benefits for Mentors, including personal growth, recognition as an expert and satisfaction from helping others to develop their skills.  (Benefits of Mentoring, 2020)
            Persons seeking mentorship would sign up to the platform and be able to choose a generalised category or specific skill they are interested in developing.  They would then be able to write a short paragraph about themselves and their situation which would then be used to attract mentors.  Mentors could also post in a similar fashion by selecting what it is that they feel they could mentor another in and mentees would be able to contact them directly.  
            After getting in contact with each other, if the two parties both mutually agree to begin  a mentor/mentee relationship, a range of features would be provided to facilitate this.  
            Chat functionality:  Text-based communication will be the primary source of collaborating between the mentee&#39;s and mentor&#39;s.  Being able to post in a message-board format will be the primary method of communication used by every user.  This will include an open discussion forum as well as private chat functionality.  
            Voice communication:  Voice communication functionality will be an important feature allowing mentee&#39;s and mentor&#39;s to communicate in a safe and secure manor.  With Voice over IP (VoIP) users will be able to use the app or the website to communicate directly without the need of sharing personal information such as phone numbers.  
            Video/Screen sharing: Users will also be able to video chat with each other and share screens, which will be beneficial as it makes collaborating and demonstrating ideas and concepts easy.  
            The platform will have full functionality on both its website and mobile application and will be free to use.  Mentor&#39;s and mentee&#39;s will be able to engage in as many mentor/mentee relationships as they like and a review system will be utilised where each participant can review those they engage with.  This will encourage meaningful interactions as your participation could be an excellent demonstration on your ability to form professional relationships and would look good to prospective employers.  
            When a mentee/mentor relationship is formed, goals and objectives can be set in order to motivate and track progress.   
            The goal would be to help users develop meaningful mentee/mentor relationships and for users to be invested in helping each other be successful.  When seeking help online, there is no investment in your success or failure by other users.  By developing a personal relationship with a mentor there is more likelihood that they want you to succeed and care about your progress.  
            The biggest drawback about launching a platform such as this would be attracting users to actually want to use it and make it work for them.  In the early stages without a solid user base it would be difficult to get the ball rolling.  
            The benefits to mentee&#39;s are numerous but you may ask, why would mentor&#39;s sign up? For the same reasons people answer questions online and help other developers, it validates their knowledge, helps them to think outside the box and would look good to a prospective employer.  
        </p>
        <h2>TOOLS, TECHNOLOGIES & SKILLS REQUIRED</h2>
    <p>In order to develop this platform the use of a software stack for web development would cover most of the basic requirements in developing a dynamic website.  The MEAN solution stack which includes database & web application frameworks would be ideal or alternatively, another similar, well rounded software stack could work.  The skills required to develop this platform would include knowledge of web development languages such as JavaScript, and also database administration and query skills for a technology such as MongoDB or MySQL.    Knowledge of VoIP technology would also be important as well as and mobile app development. </p>
    <h2>Outcome</h2>    
    <p>Potentially this Mentee/Mentor community could have wide ranging benefits for helping those who are just starting in an industry to professionally develop themselves and become more rounded individuals.  I would like to see this platform be used not just to help mentee&#39;s skill up, but also to develop professional relationships and network themselves.   Furthermore fresh graduates who are still trying to start their career could utilise a platform such as this to stay in touch and invested in the industry they want to be a part of.   Too many university graduates become dispirited and quickly fall out of touch if they don&#39;t immediately land a job in industry after they leave their studies.    
        I would like to see this platform not used only by developers and IT professionals but by a variety of industries that don&#39;t already have established support communities online.
